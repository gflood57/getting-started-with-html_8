<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like
www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML 
document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on 
the user's screen. This video does a good job of explaining.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web.
HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks".
This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">video</a> gives a good overview.
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by 
using HTML tags. This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">video</a> explains the distinction well.
</p>
<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small
mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
</p>
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
